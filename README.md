MNIST with FNN

1. Transfer the given Python code into either a script or a Jupyter notebook.
2. Make sure that both PyTorch and torchvision are installed in your working environment. If not, you can easily install them using pip with the following command: `pip install torch torchvision`.
3. Execute the script or the cells in the notebook. This should automatically initiate the download of the MNIST dataset and start the training process.
4. Once the training is complete, a plot illustrating the training and test losses over the epochs will be generated and displayed.
